 This report explores various methods of image enhancement implemented using MATLAB, aiming to improve the visual quality and interpretability of digital images. The report begins by presenting fundamental concepts in image enhancement and delves into widely-used techniques such ashistogram equalization, morphological operations, weiner filter, CLAHE and decorrelation stretch. These approaches leverage sophisticated mathematical models and computational techniques to achieve superior results in challenging scenarios, such as low-light conditions or high noise environments.
